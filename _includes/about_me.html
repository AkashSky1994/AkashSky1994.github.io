          I am a Computer Science Engineer with 4 years of experiece as a software engineer.Currently, I am pursuing MS in Computer Engineer at New York University. Before that I was working with a discovery platform startup <a href="https://www.lbb.in">LBB</a> on backend services.

          I love building things. I just completed building a pluggable dropship service to handle logistics for the ecommerce division of the company. Right now, I am working on a smart ledger system for financial audit and payout to the merchant for the company using Golang, AWS Kinesis, Redis and MySQL.

          While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
          I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
          <!-- Due to my huge interest in AI, I am pushing for a dedicated study in the field of AI and autonomous systems.

I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative 
          team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
          architecture and project management.-->
